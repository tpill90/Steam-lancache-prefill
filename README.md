Inspired by the [lancache-autofill](https://github.com/zeropingheroes/lancache-autofill) project.

# Features
* Select apps to prefill through an interactive menu.  
* Supports login with Steam Guard, and Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator
* No installation required! A completely self-contained, portable application.
* Multi-platform support (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Arm64)
* High-performance!  Downloads are significantly faster than using Steam, and can easily reach 10gbit/s or more!
* Game install writes no data to disk, so there is no need to have enough free space available.  This also means no unnecessary wear-and-tear to SSDs!

## Initial Setup
1.  Download the latest version for your OS from the [Releases](https://github.com/tpill90/steam-lancache-prefill/releases) page.
2.  Unzip to a directory of your choice
3.  (**Linux / OSX Only**)  Give the downloaded executable permissions to be run with `chmod +x ./SteamPrefill`
4.  (**Alpine Linux**) Install dependencies required by the .NET runtime : [(Alpine Linux dependencies)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-alpine#dependencies)
5.  (**Windows Only - Optional**)  Configure your terminal to use Unicode, for much nicer looking UI output.
    - <img src="docs/img/ConsoleWithUtf8.png" width="730" alt="Initial Prefill">
    - As the default console in Windows does not support UTF8, Windows Terminal should be installed from the [App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701), or [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-windows-terminal).
    - Unicode on Windows is not enabled by default, however running the following will enable it if it hasn't already been enabled.
    - `if(!(Test-Path $profile) -or !(gc $profile).Contains("OutputEncoding")) { ac $profile "[console]::InputEncoding = [console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new()";  & $profile; }`

# Getting Started

## Selecting what to prefill

Prior to prefilling for the first time, you will have to decide which apps should be prefilled.  This will be done using an interactive menu, for selecting what to prefill from all of your currently owned apps. To display the interactive menu, run the following command
```powershell
.\SteamPrefill.exe select-apps
```

Once logged into Steam, all of your currently owned apps will be displayed for selection.  Navigating using the arrow keys, select any apps that you are interested in prefilling with **space**.  Once you are satisfied with your selections, save them with **enter**.

<img src="docs/img/Interactive-App-Selection.png" height="350" alt="Interactive app selection">

These selections will be saved permanently, and can be freely updated at any time by simply rerunning `select-apps` again at any time.

## Initial prefill

Now that a prefill app list has been created, we can now move onto our initial prefill run by using 
```powershell
.\SteamPrefill.exe prefill
```

The `prefill` command will automatically pickup the prefill app list, and begin downloading each app.  During the initial run, it is likely that the Lancache is empty, so download speeds should be expected to be around your internet line speed (in the below example, a 300mbit/s connection was used).  Once the prefill has completed, the Lancache should be fully ready to serve clients cached data.

<img src="docs/img/Initial-Prefill.png" width="720" alt="Initial Prefill">

## Updating previously prefilled apps

Updating any previously prefilled apps can be done by simply re-running the `prefill` command, which will use same prefill app list as before.

**SteamPrefill** keeps track of which version of each app was previously prefilled, and will only re-download if there is a newer version of the app available.  Any apps that are currently up to date, will simply be skipped.

<img src="docs/img/Prefill-Up-To-Date.png" width="720" alt="Prefilled app up to date">


However, if there is a newer version of an app that is available, then **SteamPrefill** will re-download the app.  Due to how Lancache works, this subsequent run should complete much faster than the initial prefill (example below used a 10gbit connection).
Any data that was previously downloaded, will be retrieved from the Lancache, while any new data from the update will be retrieved from the internet.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I run SteamPrefill on the Lancache server?

You certainly can!  All you need to do is download **SteamPrefill** onto the server, and run it as you reguarly would!

If everything works as expected, you should see a message saying it found the server at `127.0.0.1`

<img src="docs/img/AutoDns-Server.png" width="580" alt="Prefill running on Lancache Server">

Running from a Docker container on the Lancache server is also supported!  You should instead see a message saying the server was found at `172.17.0.1`

<img src="docs/img/AutoDns-Docker.png" width="580" alt="Prefill running on Lancache Server in Docker">

Running on the Lancache server itself can give you some advantages over running **SteamPrefill** on a client machine, primarily the speed at which you can prefill apps.  
Since there is no network transfer happening, the `prefill` should only be limited by disk I/O and CPU throughput.  
For example, using a **SK hynix Gold P31 2TB NVME** and running `prefill --force` on previously cached game yields the following performance 
<img src="docs/img/AutoDns-ServerPerf.png" width="830" alt="Prefill running on Lancache Server in Docker">

## How can I limit download speeds?

You may want to limit the download speed of **SteamPrefill** to prevent it from potentially saturating your entire connection,  causing other devices to suffer from massive latency and poor speeds.  This issue is known as bufferbloat, and more detailed information on the issue can be found here: [What is bufferbloat?](https://www.waveform.com/tools/bufferbloat)

**SteamPrefill** does not currently contain any functionality to limit its own download speed, and due to the way that downloads are implemented will likely never be able to throttle its own download speed.  Additionally, even if **SteamPrefill** was able to throttle itself, the same issue would persist with downloads through **Steam**.

One method to limit bandwidth would be to configure *Quality of Service (QOS)* on your router, limiting bandwidth to the Lancache server, or by prioritizing other network traffic.  A general overview of QOS can be found here : [Beginners guide to QOS](https://www.howtogeek.com/75660/the-beginners-guide-to-qos-on-your-router/)

# Detailed Command Usage

## prefill

| Option      |     | Values      |     |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- | --- |
| --all       |     |             | Downloads all owned apps, useful for prefilling a completely empty cache.  |
| --recent    | -r  |             | Adds any games played within the last 2 weeks to the download queue.  |
| --top       |     | 1-100       | Downloads the most popular games by player count, over the last 2 weeks.  **Default: 50**  |
| --force     | -f  |             | By default, **SteamPrefill** will keep track of the most recently prefilled apps, and will only attempt to prefill if there it determines there a newer version available for download.  This default behavior will work best for most use cases, as no time will be wasted re-downloading files that have been previously prefilled.  <br/><br/> Running with the flag `--force` will override this behavior, and instead will always run the prefill, re-downloading all files for the specified product.  This flag may be useful for diagnostics, or benchmarking network performance.  |
| --nocache   |     |             | **SteamPrefill** will cache copies of certain files on disk, in order to dramatically speed up future runs.  These cache files will be stored in the `/Cache` directory in the same directory as **SteamPrefill**.  However, in some scenarios this disk cache can potentially take up a non-trivial amount of storage (~1gb), which may not be ideal for all use cases. |
| --quiet     |     |             | Reduces noisy log output.  By default, games that are already up to date will show a message that they are already up to date.  Specifying this option will make it so only games that have updates will be logged.  |
| --unit      |     | bits, bytes | **(Optional)** Specifies which unit to use to display download speed. **Default : bits**  |

## clear-cache
Deletes temporary cache files stored in the `/Cache` directory.  
These files are cached in order to dramatically speed up future `prefill` runs (in some cases 3X faster),
however in some cases this disk cache can potentially take up a non-trivial amount of storage (~1gb).  

<img src="docs/img/Clear-Cache.png" width="630" alt="Clear cache command">

These cache files will also build up over time, as newer versions of games are released, leaving unused cache data behind that will never be used again.

In the case that you would like to save disk space without having to constantly clear the cache, 
running `prefill` with the `--nocache` flag specified will prevent the cache files from being written in the first place.

| Option      |     |      |
| ----------- | --- | ---  |
| --yes       | -y  | Skips the prompt asking to clear the cache, and immediately begins clearing the cache.     |
