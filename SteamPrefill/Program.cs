namespace SteamPrefill
{
    /* TODO
     * Select apps - Cleanup dedicated servers + just cause multiplayer mod + tloader + red orchestra community maps from being displayed
     * Documentation - Add entry to FAQ explaining that it is possible to run this app on the server, and explain how to do that.
     * Steam family sharing is supported.  You can even prefill games while on another machine.  Should probably add this to the readme
     * Update to dotnet 7 sdk + dotnet 7 target
     
     * Update resharper dotsettings file to match Battlenet Prefill
     * Replace utf8json with System.Text.Json + Source generator
     * Unparallelize the publish script, take it from BattleNetPrefill
     * Remove Spectre.Console as a submodule, and add precompiled binary as a reference
     * Docs - Add to readme how you can login to multiple accounts.  Either two folders with two copies of the app, or setup family sharing.
     * Docs - Add an image to the main heading in the readme.  That way people have an image that they can immediately see when they come to the repo
     * Would it be useful to port the LancacheIpResolver over into its own app, in order to replace the defunct lancache diagnostics/litmus test
     * Documentation - Steam family sharing is supported.  You can even prefill games while on another machine.  Should probably add this to the readme
     * Bug - TryWaitForLoginKey() is flaky.  Steam doesn't seem to be saving credentials properly in australia.
     *       Keeps requiring password reentry.  Other users report the same
     *       What happens if Lancache is completely disabled?  Do users stay logged in?
     *       Is there a limit to the # of computers that can be logged in at the same time?  Test logging in with multiple VMs for the same account
     * Bug - Should the CdnPool get multiple regions, so that when it fails it tries to check other distinct CDNs.  Maybe this will improve reliability?
     * Feature - Could it be easier to select multiple apps on the select screen, without having to press down + space repeatedly?  
                      Possibly by holding spacebar + hitting down arrow -> keep selecting as you hit down arrow
     * Build - Fail build on both warnings + trim warnings
     * Deprecation - Remove --dns-override in a future version.
     
     * General - Promote this app on r/lanparty.
     * Update readme to include table of contents.  Make sure the formatting is similar to battlenet prefill
     * Spectre - Once pull request has been merged into Spectre, remove reference to forked copy of the project
     * CliFx - I wish there was a way to color the help text output from CliFx.  Everything is so flat, and cant draw attention to important parts
